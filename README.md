## Description

A prototype web based document store for users to login, search for, and download documents that administrators can assign to them via groups. Each group contains its own relavent documentation that administrators can then upload. An archiving system is in place when users upload documents so documents cannot be overwritten.

## Thanks & Dependencies

This project was created using the [CakePHP](http://www.cakephp.org) - The rapid development PHP framework. A number of dependencies where also used, these include:

* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
* [DataTables](https://www.datatables.net/)

The Document Store could not have happened without [IRS LTD](http://www.irs-limited.com/) giving me the opportunity to prototype one of their backlog projects.
